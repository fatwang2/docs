## Setting up

Search1API is a versatile search aggregation service that enables you to perform searches across Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, and also retrieve clear content from URLs. To acquire your API key, simply visit https://search2ai.online/api.

## Deep Search

We have introduced a new feature called "Deep Search" that enhances the search capabilities of Search1API. This mode is controlled by the `crawl_results` parameter and offers the following benefits:

- In addition to providing search summaries, Deep Search can now crawl and return the full text content of the search results.
- While the Deep Search mode may be slower compared to regular searches, it is particularly useful for in-depth searches where more comprehensive information is required.
- Please note that when using the Deep Search mode, the consumption of usage quota will be doubled.

To enable Deep Search, simply set the `crawl_results` numbers when making your API request.

## Pricing

Search1API remains an affordable solution for your search aggregation needs. The pricing structure is as follows:

- $0.99 USD for 800 queries for one-time purchase
- $0.99 USD for 1,000 queries per month
- $7.99 USD for 10,000 queries per month
- Deep Search mode: Usage quota consumption is doubled when enabled
